# NeonWhiteBootlegGD
an abandoned GDEVELOP project

this project was suposed to be complete.... but is not complete

please keep in mind that this project is a mess and was not supposed to be "shareble" so, the code is REAAALY a completely mess and theres no commentarys to help you :)


any ways, it kinda works and you can make your levels and stuff, i made it so you just need to change the animation of the 3DCard objects in the scene and all the behaiviors will work just fine.....i guess

# RULES

u can make any changes you want

**you CANNNNNOOOOT use this project for commercial porpuses**

**you CANNNNNNNOOOOOOT use MY SONGS in any other project (*at least not commercial ones*)**

in case you are using MY SONGS in an personal project you HAVE TO CREDIT ME as the COMPOSER, PRODUCER, ETC

i mean, you have to credit me anyways if you are sharing this project in somewhere

have fun with it and build levels and show me :)



if something is broken, keep in mind that can be because of an extension lmao

good luck!
